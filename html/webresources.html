                              This website gives you information on the best API’s for this year, as well as a brief summary of what they are and how to use them.
                              As someone who is fairly unfamiliar with API’s, this website is very useful. It gives you an updated, current list of some of the most
                              popular API’s, and has links to learn more about each individual one. For someone like me who is fairly new to using these, it also
                              has a great related links sections with more generalized information on API’s. The one downfall of this resource is that it’s updated
                              for 2021, and may not be continuing to be updated, so the information might grow old and outdated after a few years. It also only
                              discusses API's that are available on RapidAPI.com<br />

                              Bootstrap, while not an extremely complicated thing, is still something that I tend to have to go back and research a lot, having
                              never used it before. This website gives a great overview of Bootstrap – what it is, how to use it, how to edit it, etc. Compared
                              to most other learning-style websites like this, I feel like this one gives an in-depth explanation for everything you need to
                              know. This website is great for anybody who’s new to using bootstrap and just wants to make sure they’re using it correctly<br />

                              CSS is not a very complicated thing to learn, but I’m always forgetting small bits of it here and there. And with so much to remember,
                              this is a great reference website to refresh your mind on the possibilities of CSS. It’s a plethora of information and stays fairly
                              up-to-date with any changes to its usage. For someone who just needs a quick refresher on some of the ideas of CSS, or just wants to
                              know what it is and how to use it, this website is one of the best out there. The only small problem I can see is that it’s sometimes
                              fairly brief with explanations, which can be frustrating when you REALLY don’t understand something<br />

                              This website gives a great look at some of the old (but commonly used) attributes for HTML. Not only does this website give a whole
                              list of them, it also provides alternatives for you to use as well. And on their side menu, they also provide a similar list for
                              deprecated HTML tags. This is a great website for anyone who’s not sure whether or not their code is still up to date, or for fools
                              like me, who will just use anything that looks easy and simple without realizing you can’t. The only issue with this resource is that
                              it may not update with newer versions of HTML, and may not provide a full comprehensive list in the future.<br />

                              I am VERY new to using Node. I’ve tried using it before, and it was a train wreck to say the least. Because of this, I think it’s a great
                              idea to always look back at the basics and really make sure you have a solid foundation understanding of what Node is and how it works before
                              actually putting it to use.  This website does just that, without going into too much detail. It gives a brief idea of what Node is, how it
                              works, and how to put it to use in multiple different ways. This website is defiantly great for people new to using Node, or for anyone that’s
                              just forgotten the basics and needs a refresher. I think the only fall to this website is it may not be enough information for some, and would
                              have to be supplemented by other websites. <br />
